<!-- UPDATE_LOG -->

- Added completely optional and disabled/removed by default Termix AI, an assistant that can work with your hosts and terminals
  - This feature was added based off a 60% (yes) to 40% (no) Discord vote.
  - The assistant cannot change anything on its own. It can only read a limited set of your Termix data and propose actions, and every change or command runs only after you approve it, using your own account and permissions.
  - It has no access to credentials, SSH keys, vaults, users, roles, sessions, SSO, certificates, audit logs, or instance settings. Secrets are also stripped from anything sent to a model provider.
  - Both an admin and each user must turn it on before it does anything, and it stays off after upgrading.
- Added automations with events, channels, and steps
- Added a fleet system with snippets, packages, files, and inventory
- Added workspaces to save and restore your tab layout
- Added subhosts so hosts can be organized under a parent host
- Added Proxmox metrics integration
- Added a context aware terminal toolbar with quick links, host info, image pasting, and a movable desktop layout
- Added interactive terminal macros
- Added first-class split screen tabs
- Added a file manager trash instead of permanent deletes

- Added connection logs for RDP, VNC, and Telnet hosts
- Added native RDP launching on Windows desktop
- Added a drive file browser and drag-and-drop upload for RDP
- Added terminal image handoff so images open on your local machine
- Added custom terminal font selection
- Added trusted proxy authentication
- Added global touch input settings
- Added adaptive transfers that pick the fastest route and verify integrity
- Added adaptive polling and preloading that respond to activity and network cost
- Added adaptive SSH local echo for high latency connections
- Added custom disk and network metric options
- Added the ability to exclude specific mounts from disk usage metrics
- Added expanded snippet options
